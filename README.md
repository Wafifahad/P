The provided code is a simple program used to merge CSV files in a specified folder and divide them into smaller files as needed. Here is a detailed explanation of how the code works and the potential reasons for its usage:

The code begins by specifying two main folders: the output folder (output_folder) and the report folder (report_folder). These folders are created if they don't already exist.

The code reads all the files in the "Source" folder and selects only the files with the ".csv" extension.

For each file, it is read, and its data is merged into a list (all_data) excluding the rows containing column headers.

If there are any errors in reading the files, error reports are logged in the report folder.

If there are no errors, the merged data is written to a new file with the path "merged_file.csv" in the output folder.

The GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) is extracted from the merged file.

A new folder is created with the name of the GTIN in the output folder, and the merged file is moved to this folder.

The merged file is split into smaller-sized files (chunks) and saved in the GTIN-specific folder. The size of the smaller chunks is determined by the chunk_size variable.

The column header "GTIN;SN;BN;XD" is added at the beginning of each small file.

Confirmation messages are printed to the user to indicate the successful merging of files and their distribution into smaller files.

This code can be used in various scenarios, such as:

Merging sales or customer data spread across multiple CSV files to obtain a single file that is easier to analyze and process.
Dividing large files into smaller ones for purposes such as importing into databases or parallel data processing.
Organizing large files in a suitable manner for easy access and future analysis.
